# **App Name**: AutoApply

## Core Features:

- Profile Configuration: User profile setup, including resume upload and job preferences (location, job titles, etc.).
- Resume Tailoring: Use generative AI as a tool to customize the user's resume and cover letter to match specific job descriptions.
- Automated Job Search: Automatically search for relevant job postings on job boards based on the user's profile and preferences. Job boards such as Indeed or LinkedIn jobs. Each job board would require an individual connector.
- Application Submission: Automated submission of job applications. Since most sites will have slightly different processes for submitting applications, this MVP should probably focus on easy apply applications.
- Application Tracking: Dashboard displaying the status of each application, including applied date and current status.

- Primary color: A muted blue (#6699CC) to convey trust and professionalism.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated blue (#F0F8FF).
- Accent color: A vibrant orange (#FFB347) to highlight key actions and calls to action, such as the 'Apply' button.
- Clean, readable sans-serif font for the body text and UI elements.
- Simple and professional icons for navigation and job status indicators.
- Clear and organized layout with a focus on easy navigation and data presentation.
